# maze-solver 

## Summary 

Since I started learning React, I wanted to recreate a concept I had worked on already, which was finding a path (in particular on a grid). [I had worked on a vanilla JS grid based path finder here.](https://github.com/drewhsu86/search-grid) 

I wanted to get familiar with the way components worked in React as well as how to both execute my calculation functions and then correctly render the page. This app is front end only and doesn't have any backend persistence. However, some pre-made mazes are stored in a JSON file. Unlike my previous app, it does not allow users to draw a maze but instead lets users try to finish the same maze as the search algorithm.
